-- Notes for development of XRCLS Mod
Last update: 2015-03-15
== NOTES FOR CHECKING SYNC OF SHIPS AND WP LISTS ETC ==
Pseudo Code

1  Check this.ship and waypoint list ship are the same. 
	-- If YES then set all variables
		-- Check again to make sure no change whilst setting
			-- If changed GOTO 1 else continue
	-- If NO then reload new variable and GOTO 1


== UPDATE CHECLIST ==
1. Change version number in md.mt_logistics.main.xml
2. Ensure debugging is off
3. Change version in content.xml
4. Update forum text
5. Build new version
6. publish 

=== RELEASE PREP ===
0.9 DONE - Check Uninstall script and enable

3. Ego forum text
4. DONE - Steam workshop text
5. TODO: - User manual - get screenshots during testing
6. DONE - Check aicompat stuff
7. DONE - Publish

== CURRENT DO LIST ==
29. DONE - lockout all waypoints if captain removed or just stop ship?

23. DONE - Add in check for destroyed in all AI scripts - message to log
22. NO - NEW FEATURE OR SEPARATE STATION LOG MOD - Logs - catch summary as entries are deleted?
21. DONE -tick Coloured text entries for waypoint state on list screen 
20. DONE - --ticked -- Put red flashing warnings back on WP edit screen
19. DONE - Handled by null Sweep indicator - Check for consecutive failures of trades so that ship can undock if no trades done
18. DONE - Ship wait time is debug level dependant
17. DONE - Make ship debug level = 4 so it will turn on even if global level is set to 0
16. DONE - Put proper delays back in ship.trader ai script - maybe switchable based on debug level
15. DONE - Readtext entries for logging screens
14. DONE -tick debug switches in lua code for debug levels, game reset, and test buttons - make global var in LibMT to switch - test
13. CF
12. DONE - fix bug to prevent overloading due to starting cargo in hold
11. DONE - Sort out XP scaling by 100 ??
10. CF
9. CF
8. DONE - Limits on trade log sizes - may still need on ship trade log - time based?
7. CF
6. CF
5. CF
4. CF
3. DONE - Tracking display - add in ship location to header block
2. DONE - Switch on/off individual debugging for ship
1. DONE - Finish displaying trade ship log

== General TODO ==
1. DONE - ReadText codes - check for code decisions based on RT values and change
2. DONE - Tidy code and consolidate data structures
3. DONE - Improve section handling and return etc
4. CARRIED FORWARD General checks for save load uninstall etc etc 
5. NO - SHIPS CARRY THEIR OWN LOG - Need to add list index to global save list ($XRCLS) so that individual AI scripts can write to log 
	NO - i) Global list for log - each ship has an index variable corresponding to position in log list
	NO - ii) log list just has ship and a list of trades
	NO - iii) Should cope with ships that are destroyed - keep the list entry even when no longer available - player can delete, trades copied to another
	      list if ship log is cleared
	NO - iv) find a way of consolidating these lists and keeping the trader lists short

== CREW SKILLS ==
a) 	DONE - filter un-configured ships for inappropriate/missing crew, drones, etc - UI SCREEN
b) 	DONE - Check for crew on-board all ships - derive a "range" setting based on crew skill - UI SCREEN and AI/MD SCRIPTS <-- prevents cheating
	DONE	i) Need to add a range value to each WP - determined when WP created - WP Edit screen needs to update when homebase changed
	DONE	ii) Need to check station selected is in or out of range - WP Edit screen
	DONE	iii) Add in checks for waypoint number limit based on crew skill
c) DONE - Crew paid salary based on active flying time and avg? value of goods delivered - AI Script - salary and XP linked
d) DONE - Crew gain experience based on amount delivered and flying time i.e. time executing waypoints - AI SCRIPT - captain skill overrides Eng and DO - E and DO skill boost captain XP??
	DONE - i) Level 1 - Apprentice crew - Sector Range - combined skill < X1 - Small time based salary - 10 Waypoints
	DONE - ii) Level 2 - Courier crew - Cluster Range - X1 < combined skill < X2 - medium salary + 2% commission - 20 Waypoints
	DONE - iii) Level 3 - Logistics Crew - Galaxy Range - X2 < Combined skill < X3  - top salary + 5% commission - 40 waypoints
	DONE - iv) Need a way to store crew info so that it doesn't need to be calculated on every loop?? - might be easier just to recalc!!- AI SCRIPT
e) DONE - Train crew based on standard star rating system - UI screen
	NO! - i) Use standard Ego method
f) DONE - Low skill crews assigned to high skill WP lists miss out WPs that are for higher skill - AI SCRIPT
g) NEW FEATURE - Notifications to player that crew might be inappropriate - remove ship from duty - flag as red in ship select screen
h) NEW FEATURE - Level 3 crew to have additional skills such as refitting drones, repair to 100%(costs) etc - based on engineer and DO skills

	
	
== UI LUA CODE ==
1. DONE - Check for change in relation <-- don't want crews to fly to a hostile station or one they can't trade with <-- might already be covered in WP Edit screen
2. NEW FEATURE - Deal with construction vessel requirements??
3. DONE - Change ship and WP displays so that active/inactive/out of range WPs are displayed
4. DONE - Show crew skills on ship screen
5. DONE - Display waypoint active or not and waypoint range on list screen
6. DONE - WP List screen - show zone/sector/cluster in WP station list
7. CARRIED - Coloured text entries for waypoint state on list screen
8. CARRIED - Put red flashing warnings back on WP edit screen
9. CARRIED - Load/save waypoint lists
10. DONE - Improve paste buffer contents display in waypoint list screen

== AI SCRIPTS ==
1. DONE - Finish buy and sell code - look into load/unload issues for player stations <-- just leave as is - money only changes hands between player stations anyway
2. DONE - Check for change in relation in waypoints <-- don't want crews to fly to a hostile station or one they can't trade with
3. DONE - #9 supersedes general checks for abort and ship destroyed etc
4. NA - Only for NPC ships? have a look at attacked handlers?
5. DONE - Add in update handler for waypoint change
6. DONE - Add in update handler for debug level - ships/entities into groups
7. DONE - (not possible) Add in fly home if script aborted??
8. DONE - Add cancel reservations if script aborted

== REPORTING INTERFACE ==




== IDEAS AND REMARKS ==




== SCRATCHPAD ==
Waypoint list logic
Check wp is valid - - yes increment counter - if counter == max for crew then remaining waypoints are invalid
					-- no set to invalid - next
