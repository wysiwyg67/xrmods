Enhanced Money Transfer

== Introduction ==

MitchTech Corporation is proud to release its first update for the Pride of Albion user interface software. This small mod will improve productivity for pilots managing many stations and large accounts. The patch replaces the money transfer slider dialog with a dialog that allows the user to type in the exact amount of credits to be set in the manager's or architect's account.

== Installing ==

Simply subscribe to the mod on the Steam Workshop for x-rebirth and the mod will download and install automagically next time you start the game.

You can find the source files for the mod [url=x] on my github repository[/url] if you're interested in seeing what changes are being made under the hood.

== Usage == 

The next time you want to transfer some money to or from a station manager or architect you will be presented with an account transaction dialog box that has a single text input box where you can type the amount that you want to set the account to. Note this is the actual amount that the account will contain and NOT the amount to be transferred.

Valid inputs:
digits 0-9 e.g. 100,  1000000, 500000
numbers in exponent format e.g. 1e6, 23.67e3
numbers followed by a suffix e.g. 1m or 1M = 1000000,  1k or 1k = 1000 1.23467k = 1234 (note decimals less than 1 are truncated)
Thousand separators are NOT allowed
Multiple prefixes are NOT allowed eg 5kk will not work
